# walkthroughs

I've captured some bash sessions using `script -f ${name}.raw.typescript.log`. I sometimes then annotate them with bash comments and remove some extraneous commands.
Those are named `${name}.annotated.typescript.log`. You can view these log files with `less -r ${name}.{raw|annotated}.typescript.log`. Note that the `-r` is lowercase. There's a cap `-R` that removes escape sequences, but doesn't get it quite right.
